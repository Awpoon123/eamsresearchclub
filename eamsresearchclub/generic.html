									<p>EDISON, NJ (January 15th, 2024) — High schoolers Aditya Kirubakaran, Ethan Poon, Thomas Catuosco, and Sarayu Valluripalli hosted New Jersey’s first high school-based research convention, bringing together students and professors from all over the state. Mr. Amro Mosaad, the Edison Academy principal and Research Club advisor, was instrumental in making the event successful.</p>
									<p>Saturday’s event at Middlesex College’s Crabiel Hall brought over a hundred attendees together for an afternoon filled with keynote speeches, student presentations, and networking sessions. Professors Borcea, Chen, Hoover, and Naik of NJIT and Professor Lee of Stevens Institute of Technology attended. Members of the John P. Stevens High School Robotics Team also gave a speech about VisualEyes, a hat that assists visually impaired people.</p>
									<p>Professor Cristian Borcea discussed his contributions to mobile computing and the Internet of Things (IoT). Professor Yi Chen discussed online advertising and cookies, while Professor Kwahun Lee detailed preliminary research with T-cells. Professor Amy Hoover discussed how to use Google Scholar to access her research papers on machine learning (ML) and neural networks, connecting it back to how these concepts were applied to the famous blockbuster game, Mario. Professor Kamlesh Naik discussed his transition to academia in the field of computer science.</p>
									<p>The keynote addresses were deeply insightful, guiding students through the process of conducting research and submitting projects to prestigious science fairs, including the Terra North Jersey Science Fair and the Northern NJ Junior Science and Humanities Symposium.</p>
									<p>Kirubakaran and Poon, co-founders and co-presidents of the Edison Academy Research Club, were astounded by the overwhelming turnout and the quality of research that was presented. There were 20+ phenomenal poster presentations and 10+ video submissions detailing innovative concepts in numerous fields, from aerospace to computer science. The winners of the video presentation category discussed ML applications to wildfires and healthcare, while another featured project described the applications of deep learning and neural networks. The winning poster presentations discussed ways to stop bacterial growth through hand drying, analyzed the correlation between online medical resources and satisfaction with healthcare resources, explored the impact of sensory overload on test-taking, and studied the effect of different cooking methods on vitamin C levels in vegetables.</p>
									<p>“It’s remarkable how these students were able to develop such high-quality research projects with fairly limited guidance. They are the next generation of leaders,” said Kirubakaran. “We had a vision when creating this convention, and I can confidently say the expectations were blown out of the water.”</p>
<p>“It was amazing to see so many students asking innovative questions and understanding research at the Ph.D. level,” said Poon. “We hope that this experience prepared them to pursue future research internships!”</p>
									<p>“I was satisfied with the attendance of the convention, especially by the younger middle-school audience,” said Catuosco, Director of Outreach. “I have a lot of hope for these students to complete projects in many fields.”</p>
									<p>The Edison Academy Research Club would also like to extend their gratitude to the sponsors of the convention, including the Edison and South Plainfield PALS Learning Centers, Baseline Web Design and Marketing, Frog Social App, and Art of Problem Solving Academy Princeton.</p>
